* ### Use spritesheets from [here](https://sanderfrenken.github.io/Universal-LPC-Spritesheet-Character-Generator/) to train a LoRA or ControlNet for stable diffusion. I think trying to train a full model training would warp it too much with this setup.
  * #### LoRA
  * generate many unique character sheets using the file/folder names as tags for the image.
  * pick a solid background color to use for every image
  * individually tag certain sheets that look like actual people or characters
  * #### ControlNet
  * generate or use existing portraits that look like the characters in the sprite sheet
